# Project 02
- Complete all TODOs in franka_ik.py.
- To run the code, you need to clone this repo to ```<your-ros-workspace>/src```, and build it. Then launch the `launch_franka.py` in `/launch` folder, and you can run ```ros2 run project_02 ik_node``` in another terminal window.
- Remember to source the required files.
